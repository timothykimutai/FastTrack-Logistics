# FastTrack Logistics Dashboard

## Overview
This project provides an end-to-end analytics and dashboard solution for logistics operations. It includes synthetic data generation, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, advanced machine learning, and a production-ready Streamlit dashboard.

## Features
- Interactive dashboard for delivery KPIs, trends, and recommendations
- Advanced filtering by region, courier, date, and delay
- Predictive modeling (Random Forest regression) for delivery delay
- Model explanations (feature importances, SHAP summary plots)
- Customizable thresholds for alerts and anomaly detection
- Anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)
- Correlation heatmap, time series decomposition, and custom charting
- Downloadable filtered data and outlier reports
- User feedback form and business recommendations

## Files
- `dashboard_app.py`: Main Streamlit dashboard application
- `FastTrack_Logistics_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data workflow and analysis
- `logistics_cleaned_for_dashboard.csv`: Cleaned data for dashboard (generated by notebook)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile`: Containerization for enterprise/production deployment
- `.gitignore`: Excludes sensitive and unnecessary files from version control
